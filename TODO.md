## short-term
- Code
    - [ ] inside each module, use simplistic names instead of flatnames
    - [ ] rename `official-` types to `OfficalEvent`, `OfficalBracket`, etc.
    - [ ] rename: `record`, `record-genre`, `record-filter`; `timeline` = `record` grouped by `date`
    - [ ] replace `Raw` types with `zod` schemas for runtime validation
    - [ ] extract as many reusable components as possible, avoid code duplication
        - [ ] ParamFilterBox
        - [ ] Title: small-caps all player names
        - [ ] NavItem: add underline on current page
- UI
    - [ ] Everything clickable need to have hover color change
    - [ ] ParamFilter
        - [ ] add button on `from` and `to` in `Date` filter
        - [ ] separate `from` and `to` logic
        - [ ] MAYBE: remove confirm button, add text: `press enter to confirm`
        - [ ] MAYBE: update timeline filter on update, not on submit
    - [ ] add hover texts to clickables
    - [ ] `h1` title of each page
    - [ ] MAYBE: exact time of timeline entries
- Filter
    - [ ] UI: in player filter section, add links to specific pages of the player
    - [ ] UI: allow search in player filter sections | `searchterm.tolowercase`, show player name if slug.substring(searchterm) or player is in filter
    - [ ] feat: player filter: can be ANY mode or OR mode
    - [ ] feat: more filter dimensions: team, event, talent
    - [ ] UI: each filter box is default collapsed. non-selectedoptions are only shown when hovered
- Search
    - [ ] add a search section above filter section
    - [ ] add a `search_name" field to every timeline item to allow text-based searching
    - [ ] filter: item => streamterm.toWords.map(toLower).all(isSubstring of item.search_name)
- Content
    - [ ] Why? Page
    - [ ] Credits Page
    - [ ] Vlogs/YouTube Videos (including montages) as a Genre in Timeline | color-code: rosy red
    - [ ] Streams as a Genre in Timeline | color-code: purple
    - [ ] Event Pages
    - [ ] Add a team type independent of roster
    - [ ] Editorial Page: Articles Written by me
    - [ ] `wynd` mode: show something related to me only
- Editor UI
    - [ ] on `/event/[slug]`: a button to open an event data editor, can output json to copy/paste

## long-term
- Summary Mode: can show more items on the timeline
- Dynamic UI
    - Filter/Search sidebar only show in full when hovered 
- Narrow-Screen UI
- Advanced Searching/Filtering: Allows complex logic AND and OR
- structured timeline: date -> genre -> (if genre == match) event -> item
- `involves` takes not only `player`s but everything that inherits `entity`, including matches, events, teams, etc. 
    - Make filterable but date something of involves. A match involves its event, but not an independent event field
- Chat spam generator
